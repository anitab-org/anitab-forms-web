## Mission

**Learn more about the work weâ€™re doing to help women in tech succeed.**

At AnitaB.org, we envision a future where the people who imagine and build technology mirror the people and societies for whom they build it. We connect, inspire, and guide women in computing, and organizations that view technology innovation as a strategic imperative.

Our social enterprise supports women in technical fields, as well as the organizations that employ them and the academic institutions training the next generation. A full roster of programs help women grow, learn, and develop their highest potential.

In order to engage with the community join the [AnitaB.org Open Source Zulip](https://anitab-org.zulipchat.com/)
