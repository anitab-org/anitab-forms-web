These are some of the standards we choose to follow in this project. These might change if we agree on standards for javascript development within the community.

### Code Comments

We follow the Comments guidelines from [this style guide](https://prettier.io/playground/).

### Another Example of Coding Standard

Use the [Semantic UI Library](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) to import components as much as you can. Try and refrain from using basic HTML elements, unless they are really necessary. Keep `actions/`, `reducers/`, `styles/` and `components/` in separate directories already present.
