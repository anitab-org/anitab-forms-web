Hello Newcomer, here are some tips to help you get started contributing to this project.

## Get to know the project
Here's what you can do to know more about the project:

- Read documentation available on this website and on [README](https://github.com/anitab-org/open-source-programs-web/blob/develop/README.md).
- You can join the [#open-source-progs](https://anitab-org.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/237907-open-source-progs) channel on AnitaB.org Open Source Zulip, to see or participate in the project's discussion.
- You can browse the code on GitHub or even on your workspace after cloning it.

### Choose a working item
- Check the available issues (that anyone can contribute to) or first timers only issues (just for first-time contributors in this project).
- Choose one issue you want to work on.
- Ask maintainers, on the issue's comment section, if you can work on it.
- Once you get the approval you can start working on it.

### Start working
Before you start working check the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/anitab-org/open-source-programs-backend/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to make sure you can follow the best practices.

In short:

1. [Fork](./Fork,-Clone,-Remote-and-Pull-Request.md#fork-the-repo) the project into your profile.
2. [Clone](./Fork,-Clone,-Remote-and-Pull-Request.md#clone) the project into your workspace on your computer.
3. Setup [remotes](./Fork,-Clone,-Remote-and-Pull-Request.md#add-remote) to keep your develop branch with OSP repository.
4. Create a specific branch based from develop branch for your specific feature.
5. Start coding.
6. Make sure you follow this [Commit Message Style Guide](./Commit-Message-Style-Guide.md).
7. Once you finish working on your issue, submit a Pull Request (PR) ([following the template provided](https://github.com/anitab-org/open-source-programs-backend/blob/develop/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)).
8. If the reviewers request changes on your PR, make the changes (this can be a back and forth process where you make changes according to reviewers feedback).
9. Make sure when you finish your changes you squash your commits into a single commit.
10. Once the reviewers approve your PR, they can merge and your code will finally be part of the main repository.
