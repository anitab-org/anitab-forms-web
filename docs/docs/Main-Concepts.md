These are the main base concepts of the application:

- **User**: User represents a person that is registered in the application. This has the capability to log in to the OSP application. The User can have two roles in the system: admin or student. The default role is **student** and admins can be edited only from the backend. Future goals include the ability to invite other admins and admin approval requests.

- **Forms**: Forms can be created, edited, published, closed by admins and can be filled by the target users of the form. Your own form responses can be viewed and edited. Admins can view all responses and are provided with various filters to ease their searches.

- **Automation and filtering**: The purpose of the application was automating multiple processes involved with the selection processes and filtering of data. So automating the creation, deletion, updating of forms has been done. Also required data from Zulip APIs and GitHub APIs is being automatically fetched and hence gives an easier perspective to shortlisting students.
