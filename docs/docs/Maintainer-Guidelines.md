## Guidelines

Make sure contributors are respecting the Contribution Guidelines. If they don't let them know about it: what is missing, what was disrespected?

## Code Review

- When possible get a second opinion before merging.
- Make sure the PR has a link to the issue.
- If you can, let them know why your change request makes sense.
- (nice to have) If you have time, thank them for contributing to the project.
- **Make sure that, if the PR changes actual code, to properly test it or wait for someone to confirm the behavior**

## Merging PRs

- Minimum 2 approvals are needed to get a PR merged
- Select **Squash and Merge**.
- Edit commit if necessary to follow our [Commit Message style guide](./Commit-Message-Style-Guide.md) and leave the PR id in the message.
