For the frontend, do thorough manual testing and explore the Network tab and Console tab to keep track of any errors being faced. Many times the issues are not always with the backend.
For the backend testing refer to [API docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11324046/Szzoaw1q) attached in the Wiki and `README.md`. Run postman collections properly before changing or adding a feature.
